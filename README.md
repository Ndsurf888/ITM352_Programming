My name is Noah Duran. I am double majoring in Finance and MIS and am really interested in learning more about MIS and becoming a technologist. I like to surf and I also sell real estate.

I decided to major in MIS because I believe that Technology is very important for the business world.  I want to learn the ins and outs of how MIS is used to help a business make more money. I also like the idea that im going to be able to think somthing up and then actually bring it to life online.
